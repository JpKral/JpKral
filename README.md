- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JpKral
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in network engineering

I'm currently studying network engineering through certifications (A+, CCNA) and would love to keep working in the data center environment. I love building computers, administrating systems, and working directly with customers.
Besides my career roadmap, I enjoy working with lua to build game scripts, python for irl electronic projects, and modding on the source engines. 

I currently live in Colorado and love to hike a lot. I love the outdoors and to experience the beauty of nature and its colder snowy environments. 

If you wish to contact me for any reason, like collaboration or needing help, please feel free to get in contact with me :) I enjoy working with people, regardless of where they are in career or knowledge.
There's always something new for me to learn from other people, so I see every interaction a opportunity for benefit.

Thank you,
Jeremy Kral
